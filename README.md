Template files for quickly creating Burp Suite extensions

For when you want to knock up something quick and dirty to do some custom work in Burp Suite during a test. These are intended to be mostly working examples of common Burp extensions written in a way to allow them to be easily modified to perform (what I think will be) common extension style tasks.
